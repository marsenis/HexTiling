<p>
Consider the problem of counting the number of ways one can tile a regular
hexagon of side N with unit-sized rhombuses. Each rhombus is allowed to be
rotated in three ways, depicted with three different colors in the figure on
the right. In solving this problem, it is useful to introduce some bijections
between tilings, cube stackings in 3D space and vertex disjoint paths on a
grid.  The purpose of this exposition is to provide an interactive tool for
understanding one side of such a bijection.
</p>

<p>
For example, look at the figure on the right where a hexagon of side N = 4 is
tilled with rhombuses. It might be a bit unintuitive at first, but with some
imagination one can interpret the picture as showing cubes, stacked on top of
each other in 3D space. Specifically, the red tiles correspond to top faces of
cubes (or sometimes parts of the "floor" of the room), and the blue and yellow
tiles correspond to side faces (or parts of the "walls" of the room). One way
to represent a given configuration of stacked cubes is by an NxN matrix of
integers denoting the height of each stack. An example of such a matrix is
shown on the right corresponding to the particular tiling on the picture.
</p>

<p>
A given tiling can always be viewed as such a configuration of stacked cubes
(and vice-versa) provided that no stack of cubes is completely hidden behind
others. In the matrix representation, this condition translates to the
requirement that the elements of each row and column are in <em>decreasing
order</em>.
</p>

<p>
This tool allows you to edit the matrix of cube stack heights to any other
valid configuration and by clicking <em>Draw</em> it will automatically produce
the corresponding tiling of the hexagon. Try it out! You can modify the value
of N by just adding/removing rows/columns. Just make sure the matrix is still
valid, i.e. for an NxN matrix, each entry should be an integer in the interval
[0, N] and every row and column should be decreasing in left-to-right and
top-to-bottom order respectively.
